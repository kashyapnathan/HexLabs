In this project, we create a machine learning model and dashboard to provide real time fraud detection for small businesses.

This dataset has been processed, split into train and test, and it was used for training, testing, and comparison using the Jupyter Notebook file provided.

Run the notebook to get the joblib file and final dataset which was then used for our Flask and React based web application.
